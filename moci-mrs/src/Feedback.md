####Problems
- Inconsistent order when data in JSON format is parsed.
- Case Sensitive.                                                        ¡Ì                                     

####Proposals
- add Operators like "Not Equal" and so on.
- auto-save when clicking "Active" Button.
- more simple syntax like POSTMAN, for example, fill out the form to edit configuration, rather than handwriting plain text
